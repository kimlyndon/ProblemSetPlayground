 ### Exercise 1
 
 For each of the following names and types, create a variable or constant that best represents it:
 
 - gallonsRemainingInTank (`Double`)
 - ageOfSpecimenInWeeks (`Int`)
 - birthplace (`String`)
 - myFirstProgrammingLanguage (`String`)
 */

//: ### Exercise 2
//: Make the minimal changes necessary to fix the following compiler errors related to assignment, variables, and constants.
var favoriteLanguage: String = "Swift"
gallonsRemainingInTank = Double(5)
ageOfSpecimenInWeeks = 32
let bestProgrammingLanguage: String = myFirstProgrammingLanguage

//: ### Exercise 3
//: Below is some code to reverse a string. We've declared `stringToReverse` and `arrayOfCharacters` as variables. Rewrite this code to reverse a string using only constants declared with `let`, no variables. **Note**: In the new version you may use as many constants as you'd like.
let stringToReverse = String("Mutable or Immutable? That is the question.")

/*: 
### Exercise 4

 For the following descriptions, create a variable or constant that best represents it:

- an `Int` value representing the hunger level of an animal over time.
- an `Int` value representing the score always required to win a game.
- a `String` value representing a studentâ€™s birthday.
- a `String` value representing what a user types into the status update area.
*/
var hungerLevel = Int(3)
let scoreToWin = Int(21)
let birthday = String("May 11") //*Changed to constant since player's birthday will not change during runtime of game. 
var statusUpdate = String("Plugging along!")
